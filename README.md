# Transportation-Optimisation
A traffic flow problem where regional planners want to reduce total kilometres driven by introducing a ferry service across a bay.

The problem is modelled as a minimum-cost multi-commodity flow problem, where each origin-destination trip follows a single path.

The task is to first calculate the total travel distance without the ferry (399,250 km), then introduce the ferry and compute the kilometres saved using GurobiPy.
